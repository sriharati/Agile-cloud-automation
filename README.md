# Agile-cloud-automation

The prominent aim of this project is to create SQL Queries (DDL scripts) from a database created by class diagrams. These class diagrams are generated by using the PLANTUML methodology that helped us to create classes, attributes, and associations. The Scope of this project is that the scripts can be understandable to the programmer without prior knowledge of any specific language.


**Future work**
Future work is created in this DSL project. As the class diagrams cannot only generate class, attributes, and associations regarding the system.

**Limitations**
The DSL is narrowly used within the intended domain and purpose. Although itâ€™s understandable and user-friendly, future development can create additional efforts and implementation.
