# Agile-cloud-automation

The prominent aim of this project is to create SQL Queries (DDL scripts) from a database created by class diagrams. These class diagrams are generated by using the PLANTUML methodology that helped us to create classes, attributes, and associations. The Scope of this project is that the scripts can be understandable to the programmer without prior knowledge of any specific language.
